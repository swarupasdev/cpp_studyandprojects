#### 1.  Everyone watching * [Project1](https://github.com/swarupasdev/cpp_studyandprojects/tree/main/Project1) is only for understanding c++ .You can downlaod it. Opne the .slnx file in your relative IDE and enjoy whatever and however I have understood all these.
#### 2.  Everyone watching * [Project2](https://github.com/swarupasdev/cpp_studyandprojects/tree/main/Project2) is only for understanding c++ .You can downlaod it. Opne the .slnx file in your relative IDE and enjoy whatever and however I have understood all these.

#### 3.		Everyone watching * [pointer.cpp](https://github.com/swarupasdev/cpp_studyandprojects/tree/main/pointer.cpp)		is only for understanding pointer in c++. In this guide, I simplifies the concept of pointers in C++ by stripping away complex syntax to define them fundamentally as integers that store memory addresses. By using a linear street metaphor where every house represents a byte of data with a unique number, the text illustrates how pointers allow programmers to locate and manipulate specific points in a computer's memory. The discussion clarifies that while data types help the compiler understand how much memory to read or write through dereferencing, the pointer itself remains a simple numerical address regardless of what it points to. Ultimately, the source aims to demystify this intimidating topic by demonstrating how to allocate memory, use the ampersand operator to find addresses, and even manage pointers to pointers to gain direct control over a computer's most vital resource.
